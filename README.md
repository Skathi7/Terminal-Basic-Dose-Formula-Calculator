# Dose Calculator
This is meant to be a super simple java dose calculator displayed in terminal/command-line, it uses the a very basic dose formula to calculate a dose based on the user's inputed values. Do not use this to calculate real world doses, this is more meant as a demonstration of the code. The formula that is used is (desired dose/amount on hand) * number of tablets
